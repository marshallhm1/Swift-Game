# LifeSim
Life simulator for iPhone. Currently in development.

LifeSim is a SwiftUI-based mobile application designed to simulate various aspects of a virtual life, offering an engaging and interactive experience. 
Users can create and customize their virtual character, make important life decisions, 
and navigate through a wide range of scenarios, including family interactions, friendships, financial choices, and more. 
The app utilizes SwiftUI for the user interface, incorporates complex data modeling, and integrates dynamic content generation for a lifelike experience.

Notable features of LifeSim include:

Character Customization: Users can personalize their character's name, school, nationality, occupation, and more.
Family and Friends Interaction: Simulates family dynamics and friendships with interactive dialogs and events.
Decision-Making: Offers a variety of decision-based scenarios that influence the character's health, wealth, and relationships.
Random Events: Introduces unpredictability through random events, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

I have been working on this app for about a month, so the UI is still relatively simple while I work on backend features.
